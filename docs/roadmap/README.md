# Araguaney App — Roadmap

Phased plan for the mobile client. Same working method as the backend
repository: each phase is a file with objectives, non-objectives, tasks with
complexity, and a suggested order; totals live here. Phases build on each
other — the offline queue (06) deliberately comes after the online write path
(05) so that going offline changes *when* a capture is submitted, never *what*
it contains.

## Overall progress

Counted from the task tables of each phase file, which are the source of truth.
A row is done, partial, blocked/external, or pending; the totals below are the
sum of those rows and nothing else. **The «Pending» column holds everything that
is not done**, partial and blocked rows included, with the breakdown in the
progress cell — otherwise a blocked row disappears from the board while still
being work. Recounted against the tables on 2026-09-04, which is what moved the
total from 242 rows to 243: Phase 23's blocked row was annotated but never
added.

**Phase 10 is excluded from the total.** It is a backlog of candidate blocks,
not a task list: its own header says that a block gets split into its own phase
when it is scheduled. Counting it alongside the phases it graduates into
double-counts the same work — shipments are one row there and six tasks in
Phase 15 — and makes the board read as permanently unfinished. It keeps its
row below so the surface stays visible.

**The total fell from 88 % to 57 % on 2026-08-24, and nothing was undone.**
What changed is the denominator. Until that day the board measured this
application against its own list of phases, and that list had never been
compared to what the panel offers. [Parity with the
panel](parity-with-the-panel.md) is that comparison, derived rather than
remembered, and Phases 17 to 30 are what it found. A percentage is only as
honest as the list it divides by, and the old one was flattering because it was
short.

**Phase 11 reads as complete and is, against its own table.** That table listed
seven screens and left out every screen somebody sees before signing in, so the
phase closed without them ever being scheduled. Phase 16 is that omission,
written down and being paid off. A percentage is only as honest as the list it
divides by.

## What is missing, and how that is kept honest

[`parity-with-the-panel.md`](parity-with-the-panel.md) compares the panel's
navigation, its routes and the vendored contract against what this application
calls, and carries the command that regenerates the number. On 2026-08-24: 161
generated operations, 69 used, 92 unused.

Phases 17 to 30 come from that file. Several of them graduate blocks out of
Phase 10, which is what that backlog says should happen to a block when it is
scheduled.

## Blocked work

What this application needs from the backend is collected in
[`docs/backend-requests.md`](../backend-requests.md), with what each request
unblocks and what the application does instead meanwhile. The entries below are
the ones that block roadmap tasks.

- **Phase 08 is closed and nothing in it is blocked any more.** What used to
  stand here — the Play developer account, the app in its console, the listing
  assets — was resolved between 2026-08-16 and 2026-08-23: the account was
  registered on the 20th, the internal track received its first installable AAB
  the same day, and the listing landed on the 23rd. The upload keystore and the
  Sentry DSN remain key material that does not belong in a repository; both are
  documented and the build reads them from outside, which is why a fork still
  builds without them.
- **Phase 03 is complete.** Its last task was recorded as blocked on a missing
  endpoint; the endpoint existed. The screen ships as «Capturado por categoría»,
  which is what the number means. Reading it as stock needs request 1.
- **Phase 10, block 8 (Riverpod 3.x)** is blocked on the package ecosystem, not
  on this repository: `riverpod >=3.0.0-dev` cannot resolve alongside
  `drift_dev` and stable Flutter's `flutter_test` pins. Verified against the
  solver, not assumed.

## Dependencies worth naming

- **01 → everything networked.** No feature talks to the backend except through
  the generated client and its typed failures.
- **02 → 03, 05, 06, 07.** Session identity gates data scoping, writes, the
  per-user queue, and token registration.
- **05 → 06.** The offline queue reuses the online capture flow unchanged; it
  is a submission strategy, not a second form.
- **07 is unblocked and all but done.** The endpoints are live, the application
  is registered in Firebase, and everything from the token to the tap is wired.
  What remains is the `foss` packaging, which is a release concern.
  **09 still waits on the Apple Developer Program.**
- **08 is closed**, account and keystore included, so no phase waits on it any
  more. **12 depends on nothing** — no endpoint, no permission, no contract
  change — which makes it the one body of work that can start on any day.

## First release target

The first internal-testing release worth handing to a real center is
**Phases 01–06 + 08**: login, consult offline, scan, capture online and
offline, distributed through Play internal testing. Push (07), iOS (09), and
parity blocks (10) follow.

**That target was met.** Phases 01–06 and 08 are done, the account and the
keystore exist, and an AAB has been installed from the internal track on a real
phone. Push (07) followed and is all but closed — what is left there is the
`foss` packaging, a release concern rather than a feature.

What stands between the current state and a wider release is of two kinds, and
only one is code. **Phase 12 is the only unstarted body of work**, and it is
unblocked. Everything else pending is either a device pass — nineteen rows
across Phases 13 to 30 that ask somebody to scan a real package, approve a real
application, follow a real shipment — or waiting on something a repository
cannot provide: the Apple Developer Program (09), a reader of Portuguese
(31.7), a backend contract (18.3, 23.5, 24.2), or a package ecosystem that does
not resolve yet (Phase 10, block 8).
