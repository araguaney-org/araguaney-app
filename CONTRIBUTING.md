# Contributing to Araguaney App

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document describes the conventions and the workflow this repository follows. They mirror the conventions of the [backend repository](https://github.com/araguaney-org/araguaney) so that the two projects feel like one system.

## Ground rules

1. **This is a thin client.** Business rules (validation, state machines, tenant scoping, risk controls) live in the backend and are enforced there. If a feature seems to require business logic in the client, the correct first step is usually a backend endpoint, not client-side logic. Pull requests that duplicate backend rules in the client will be asked to restructure.

2. **The API contract is additive-only.** The application consumes the backend's `/v1` API through a Dart client generated from the vendored OpenAPI snapshot (`api/openapi.json`). Do not hand-edit generated code. To pick up new backend capabilities, update the snapshot in its own commit and regenerate.

3. **Deliberate boundaries are not bugs.** Some behaviors that may look like missing features are documented domain rules — most notably, offline writing is limited to donation intake capture. Read `docs/design/` before proposing changes to these areas.

## Language conventions

- **All identifiers are written in English**: functions, variables, classes, files, routes.
- **Product prose is written in Spanish**: user-facing strings, error messages shown to operators, and domain documentation. The platform operates in Spanish-speaking collection centers.
- **Contributor-facing prose is written in English**: commit messages, pull request text, and all repository documentation (this file, the README, the security policy, and everything under `docs/`).
- **Pull requests are bilingual**: the title is written in English and the body carries the same content twice, an `## English` section first and an `## Español` section after it. The Spanish section is not an abridged summary of the English one.

## Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main` (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `refactor/…`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`). Direct pushes to `main` are not accepted.
2. Commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`type: description`).
3. Ensure quality gates pass locally before opening a pull request:
   - `flutter analyze` with no issues,
   - `dart format` applied,
   - `flutter test` passing.
4. Open a pull request describing what problem it solves, how, what does not change, and how it was verified.

## Testing expectations

- New behavior comes with tests (unit or widget as appropriate).
- Code that touches the local database or the offline queue is tested against a real in-memory SQLite database, not mocks: most defects in that layer live in transaction handling, and mocks do not reproduce them.
- Test names are written in English.
