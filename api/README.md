# API contract snapshot

`openapi.json` is a vendored copy of the OpenAPI specification published by the
[Araguaney backend](https://github.com/araguaney-org/araguaney). The Dart client
under `lib/core/api/generated/` is produced from this file and from nothing else.

## Why a snapshot instead of fetching the live specification

- **Reviewable diffs.** A contract change arrives as a readable diff in a pull
  request instead of appearing silently the next time someone regenerates.
- **Deterministic builds.** The generated client depends on a file in the
  repository, not on whichever backend happened to be reachable at build time.
- **Forks build offline.** Anyone can clone this repository and compile without
  access to a running backend.

The snapshot is stored with sorted keys and fixed indentation so that a refresh
diff shows what changed in the contract, not what changed in the serializer.

## Refreshing the snapshot

Do this in its own commit, separate from any feature work.

1. Obtain the specification from a running backend:

   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:8000/openapi.json \
     | python3 -c 'import json,sys; json.dump(json.load(sys.stdin), open("api/openapi.json","w"), indent=2, ensure_ascii=False, sort_keys=True)'
   printf '\n' >> api/openapi.json
   ```

2. Regenerate the client and format the output:

   ```bash
   dart run swagger_parser
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   dart format lib/core/api/generated
   ```

3. Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`, then commit both the snapshot and
   the regenerated client together.

CI enforces step 2: the `api-client` job regenerates from the committed snapshot
and fails if the committed client differs. Never edit generated files by hand.

## Generation scope

The snapshot is kept complete and faithful to what the backend publishes, but
`swagger_parser.yaml` restricts generation to `/v1/**`. Left out are the health
probe, the third-party webhook, and the public by-code pages, which serve HTML
or PNG to a browser rather than data to a typed client.

## Known upstream defects

Both are recorded here rather than worked around silently, because each one has
a one-line fix in the backend that would let this repository drop its
workaround.

**1. Duplicate `operationId` on the health probe.** The backend exposes
`GET /health/jobs` and `HEAD /health/jobs` under a single `operationId`, which
the OpenAPI specification does not allow and which makes two generated methods
collide. It does not affect this application because the generation scope
excludes that path.

**2. Untyped login response.** `POST /v1/auth/login` does not declare a
`response_model`, so the contract publishes an empty response schema and the
generated method returns `void`, discarding the session it actually returns.
Until the backend declares `response_model=Token`, `AuthRepository.login` issues
that one request by hand. The response is still deserialized with the generated
`Token` model, so the shape keeps coming from the contract rather than from a
hand-written copy that would drift. Declaring the response model is additive and
breaks no existing client.
